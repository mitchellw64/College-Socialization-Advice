    <h2 style="font-family: Calibri";>Inspirations for College Socialization Advice</h2>
    
    <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: +18;">As two college students at the University of Connecticut, we know firsthand the struggles that come with living in a completely new environment away from home. It can be extremely difficult to find new friends and keep yourself busy while at school. We wanted to create something that could benefit anyone finding themselves in the same situation, as this problem is much more common than people think. We wanted to take our own experiences at school and create something fun that can help others struggling too. </p><br>
